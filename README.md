# memory-game

## Project

This is a project to build a website to play a pokemon memory game.
It uses only html, css and javascript.

No librairies required.

Use python -m http.server 3000 if cache issues.

## Playing rules

- If you're a beginner, then it's a classic memory game.
- If you know well the pokemon, then the initiate mode invites you to guess the generation of the pokemon you try to match.
- And if you master the pokedex, you can try to guess the official pokemon id to validate your pairs.

Have fun !
